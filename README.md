# Basic Alarm App

This is a basic alarm app built using JavaScript. The app allows users to set an alarm time and receive an alert when the specified time is reached.

## Features

- Set a specific alarm time.
- Receive an alert when the alarm time is reached.

## Usage

1. Open the `alaram.html` file in a web browser.
2. The app will display a simple user interface with an input field to set the alarm time.
3. Enter the desired alarm time in the format `HH:MM` (24-hour format).
4. Click the "Set Alarm" button to set the alarm.
5. Once the alarm time is reached, the app will display an alert.

## Implementation Details

- The app uses JavaScript to capture user input and perform the alarm functionality.
- It utilizes the `Date` object to compare the current time with the alarm time.
- The alarm time is set by combining the current date with the user-specified time.
- When the alarm time is reached, an alert is displayed using the `alert()` function.
